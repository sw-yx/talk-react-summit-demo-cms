This is a basic CMS with React and TypeScript and you can add an AWS backend easily with GraphQL.

We also use [Chakra UI v1.0](https://next.chakra-ui.com/) for styling our components because it is awesome.

I will update this with more info from the talk in future, pls [remind me](https://twitter.com/swyx) if i forget.
